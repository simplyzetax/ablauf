# Workflow Lifecycle

Workflows in Ablauf move through various states as they execute. Understanding these states helps you manage and monitor your workflows effectively.

## Status States

A workflow can be in one of the following states:

- **`"created"`** — Initialized, but not yet running
- **`"running"`** — Actively executing steps
- **`"completed"`** — Finished successfully with a result
- **`"errored"`** — Failed with an unrecoverable error
- **`"paused"`** — Manually paused (can be resumed)
- **`"sleeping"`** — Waiting for a timer (`step.sleep()` or retry backoff)
- **`"waiting"`** — Waiting for an external event
- **`"terminated"`** — Manually terminated (permanent)

## Getting Status

Check a workflow's current state with the `status()` method:

```ts
// Untyped — returns WorkflowStatusResponse
const status = await ablauf.status(workflowId);
```

For better TypeScript support, pass your workflow class as a second argument:

```ts
// Typed — narrows payload and result types
const status = await ablauf.status(workflowId, OrderWorkflow);
// status.payload is typed as OrderPayload
// status.result is typed as OrderResult | null
```

### Status Response Shape

The status response includes everything you need to understand a workflow's current state:

```ts
{
  id: string;
  type: string;
  status: WorkflowStatus;
  payload: unknown; // (typed with workflow class)
  result: unknown;  // (typed with workflow class)
  error: string | null;
  steps: StepInfo[];
  createdAt: number;
  updatedAt: number;
}
```

Each `StepInfo` entry provides:

```ts
{
  name: string;
  status: "completed" | "failed";
  attempts: number;
  result?: unknown;
  error?: string;
  startedAt: number;
  completedAt?: number;
}
```

## Pausing and Resuming

Sometimes you need to temporarily halt a workflow — maybe you're debugging, or waiting for maintenance to complete. Ablauf makes this graceful:

```ts
await ablauf.pause(workflowId);
// Workflow stops at the next step boundary
```

<Callout type="info">
Pause is graceful — it doesn't interrupt a running step. The workflow finishes its current step, then pauses before the next one. Think of it as putting your workflow on a coffee break.
</Callout>

When you're ready to continue:

```ts
await ablauf.resume(workflowId);
// Workflow replays and continues from where it left off
```

The workflow will replay its execution history (using cached results from completed steps) and resume at the point where it paused.

## Terminating

If a workflow needs to be permanently stopped, use `terminate()`:

```ts
await ablauf.terminate(workflowId);
// Workflow is permanently stopped — cannot be resumed
```

Unlike pause, termination is **permanent**. The workflow moves to the `"terminated"` state and cannot be resumed. Its execution history and state remain stored, but it will never run again.

### When to Terminate

Termination is useful when:
- A workflow was created with incorrect input and needs to be abandoned
- Business logic determines the workflow is no longer needed
- You need to cancel a long-running process

## Status Transitions

Here's how workflows typically move between states:

```
created → running → completed
              ↓
            errored
              ↓
         (paused) → (resumed) → running
              ↓
         (sleeping) → running
              ↓
         (waiting) → running
              ↓
        terminated
```

A workflow in `"paused"`, `"sleeping"`, or `"waiting"` is essentially suspended — it's not actively executing steps, but it will resume automatically (for sleep/wait) or manually (for pause).
