import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

## Overview

`step.sleep()` pauses a workflow for a specified duration using Durable Object alarms. No resources consumed while sleeping, no memory held, no charges for nap time.

```ts
await step.sleep("wait-before-retry", "30s");
await step.sleep("cool-down-period", "5m");
await step.sleep("wait-for-next-day", "24h");
```

<Callout type="info">
**Sleeping workflows consume zero resources.** The Durable Object is hibernated and only wakes up when the alarm fires. Sleep for a week? That's fine. Sleep for a month? Also fine. Cloudflare won't charge you for time spent dreaming.
</Callout>

## Basic Usage

```ts
const workflow = defineWorkflow({
	type: "scheduled-reminder",
	input: z.object({ userId: z.string() }),
	run: async (step, payload) => {
		await step.do("send-immediate-email", async () => {
			await sendEmail(payload.userId, "Thanks for signing up!");
		});

		// Wait 7 days
		await step.sleep("wait-one-week", "7d");

		await step.do("send-follow-up-email", async () => {
			await sendEmail(payload.userId, "How are you liking the product?");
		});

		return { remindersSent: 2 };
	},
});
```

The workflow sends an immediate email, sleeps for 7 days (consuming zero resources during that time), then sends a follow-up email.

## Duration Formats

Duration strings support the following units:

| Unit | Example | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `ms` | `"500ms"` | Milliseconds |
| `s` | `"30s"` | Seconds |
| `m` | `"5m"` | Minutes |
| `h` | `"24h"` | Hours |
| `d` | `"7d"` | Days |

```ts
await step.sleep("brief-pause", "500ms");
await step.sleep("half-minute", "30s");
await step.sleep("five-minutes", "5m");
await step.sleep("one-hour", "1h");
await step.sleep("one-week", "7d");
```

Invalid duration strings throw `InvalidDurationError`:

```ts
// ❌ Invalid formats
await step.sleep("bad", "5"); // Missing unit
await step.sleep("bad", "5 seconds"); // Space not allowed
await step.sleep("bad", "5y"); // 'y' is not a valid unit

// ✅ Valid formats
await step.sleep("good", "5s");
await step.sleep("good", "500ms");
```

## How It Works

Here's what happens when you call `step.sleep()`:

### First Execution

1. Creates a "sleeping" step in SQLite with a `wakeAt` timestamp
2. Throws a `SleepInterrupt` (not an Error — this is normal flow control)
3. The workflow runner catches the interrupt
4. The Durable Object sets an alarm for the `wakeAt` time
5. The Durable Object hibernates

### When the Alarm Fires

1. The Durable Object wakes up
2. The step is marked as "completed" in SQLite
3. The workflow replays from the beginning
4. All previous steps return cached results instantly
5. `step.sleep()` sees the step is completed and returns immediately
6. Execution continues past the sleep

### Subsequent Replays

On any future replay (even years later), the completed sleep step returns instantly. The workflow doesn't sleep again.

## Use Cases

### Rate Limiting

Implement backoff between API calls:

```ts
for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
	await step.do(`process-item-${i}`, async () => {
		await processItem(items[i]);
	});

	if (i < items.length - 1) {
		await step.sleep(`rate-limit-${i}`, "1s");
	}
}
```

### Scheduled Reminders

Send time-delayed notifications:

```ts
const workflow = defineWorkflow({
	type: "trial-reminder-sequence",
	input: z.object({ userId: z.string() }),
	run: async (step, { userId }) => {
		await step.sleep("wait-3-days", "3d");
		await step.do("send-3-day-reminder", async () => {
			await sendEmail(userId, "3 days left in your trial!");
		});

		await step.sleep("wait-2-more-days", "2d");
		await step.do("send-1-day-reminder", async () => {
			await sendEmail(userId, "Last day of your trial!");
		});

		await step.sleep("wait-final-day", "1d");
		await step.do("convert-or-downgrade", async () => {
			await handleTrialExpiration(userId);
		});
	},
});
```

### Retry with Backoff

Implement custom retry logic:

```ts
let attempt = 0;
const maxAttempts = 5;

while (attempt < maxAttempts) {
	try {
		const result = await step.do(`attempt-${attempt}`, async () => {
			const res = await fetch("https://flaky.api/data");
			if (!res.ok) throw new Error("API error");
			return res.json();
		});

		return result; // Success!
	} catch (error) {
		attempt++;
		if (attempt < maxAttempts) {
			// Exponential backoff: 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s
			const delay = Math.pow(2, attempt);
			await step.sleep(`backoff-${attempt}`, `${delay}s`);
		}
	}
}

throw new Error("All attempts failed");
```

(Though for this use case, you'd probably just use `step.do()` with the built-in `retries` option!)

## Step Name Uniqueness

Like all step primitives, sleep step names must be unique within a workflow run:

```ts
// ❌ This will throw DuplicateStepError
await step.sleep("pause", "5s");
await step.sleep("pause", "10s");

// ✅ This is fine
await step.sleep("first-pause", "5s");
await step.sleep("second-pause", "10s");
```

## Performance Notes

Sleeping workflows consume zero compute resources. The Durable Object is completely hibernated during the sleep period. You can have thousands of workflows sleeping for days or weeks without any resource concerns.

The only limit is Cloudflare's alarm scheduling limits:
- Maximum alarm time is approximately 1 year in the future
- Alarms are reliable and survive Durable Object migrations

For workflows that need to sleep longer than a year, chain multiple sleep steps together. (But seriously, maybe rethink your workflow design at that point.)
