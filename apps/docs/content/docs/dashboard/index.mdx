# Dashboard

Ablauf includes built-in observability and a React dashboard for monitoring your workflows. Whether you're debugging in development or monitoring production, you have full visibility into workflow state, step execution, and errors.

## What You Get

- **Workflow List** — Browse all instances with filtering by type and status
- **Detail View** — Inspect payload, result, and error details for any workflow
- **Step Timeline** — Visualize step execution with a Gantt chart
- **Retry History** — See per-attempt details for steps with retry logic
- **Live Updates** — Real-time SSE updates as workflows execute

## Quick Start

<Callout type="info">
The dashboard connects to your worker's oRPC endpoint. Make sure you've [set up the API handlers](/docs/server#setting-up-the-dashboard-api) first.
</Callout>

### Install

```bash
npm install @ablauf/dashboard
```

### Run

```bash
npx ablauf-dashboard --url http://localhost:8787
```

The dashboard opens in your browser and connects to your worker's RPC endpoint automatically.
