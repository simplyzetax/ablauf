# Dashboard

Ablauf includes built-in observability and a React dashboard for monitoring your workflows. Whether you're debugging in development or monitoring production, you have full visibility into workflow state, step execution, and errors.

## What You Get

- **Workflow List** — Browse all instances with filtering by type and status
- **Detail View** — Inspect payload, result, and error details for any workflow
- **Step Timeline** — Visualize step execution with a Gantt chart
- **Retry History** — See per-attempt details for steps with retry logic
- **Live Updates** — Real-time SSE updates as workflows execute

## Setup

### Install

```bash
npm install @der-ablauf/dashboard
```

### Add the API Handlers

The dashboard needs an RPC endpoint to communicate with your worker. Add this to your worker:

```ts
import { Ablauf } from '@der-ablauf/workflows';
import { Hono } from 'hono';
import { env } from 'cloudflare:workers';

const ablauf = new Ablauf(env.WORKFLOW_RUNNER, {
	workflows: [OrderWorkflow, PaymentWorkflow],
});

const { rpcHandler, openApiHandler } = ablauf.createHandlers();

app.all('/__ablauf/*', async (c) => {
	const { matched, response } = await openApiHandler.handle(c.req.raw, {
		prefix: '/__ablauf',
		context: ablauf.getDashboardContext(),
	});
	if (matched) return c.newResponse(response.body, response);

	const { matched: matchedRpc, response: rpcResponse } = await rpcHandler.handle(c.req.raw, {
		prefix: '/__ablauf',
		context: ablauf.getDashboardContext(),
	});
	if (matchedRpc) return c.newResponse(rpcResponse.body, rpcResponse);

	return new Response('Not Found', { status: 404 });
});
```

<Callout type="warn">
	The `/__ablauf` prefix can be anything you want, but make sure it matches when you run the dashboard CLI. Also, **don't expose this in
	production** without adding authentication — it provides full read access to all workflow data.
</Callout>

### Run the Dashboard

Once your worker is running, start the dashboard:

```bash
npx ablauf-dashboard --url http://localhost:8787
```

The dashboard opens in your browser and connects to your worker's RPC endpoint automatically.

## Listing Workflows

Ablauf tracks all workflow instances by type, allowing you to query and filter them programmatically:

```ts
// List all instances of a workflow type
const orders = await ablauf.list('process-order');

// Filter by status
const running = await ablauf.list('process-order', { status: 'running' });

// Limit results (sorted by updatedAt, newest first)
const recent = await ablauf.list('process-order', { limit: 10 });
```

Each entry in the list is a `WorkflowIndexEntry`:

```ts
{
	id: string;
	status: string;
	createdAt: number;
	updatedAt: number;
}
```

For full details about a specific workflow, use `ablauf.get(OrderWorkflow, { id }).getStatus()`.

## Shard Configuration

Under the hood, Ablauf uses **shard-based indexing** with dedicated Durable Objects for index storage. When observability is enabled, every workflow state change is recorded in one or more index shards.

By default, Ablauf uses a single shard per workflow type. For high-volume workflows (thousands of instances), you can increase the shard count to distribute load:

```ts
const ablauf = new Ablauf(env.WORKFLOW_RUNNER, {
	workflows: [
		[HighVolumeWorkflow, { shards: 8 }],
		[LowVolumeWorkflow, { shards: 1 }], // default
	],
});
```

<Callout type="info">
	More shards = better write throughput for high-volume workflow types, but queries need to fan out to all shards. Start with the default
	(1) and scale up as needed.
</Callout>

## Disabling Observability

If you don't need the list/dashboard features, you can disable observability to save on Durable Object operations:

```ts
const ablauf = new Ablauf(env.WORKFLOW_RUNNER, {
	workflows: [OrderWorkflow],
	observability: false,
});

// ablauf.list() will throw ObservabilityDisabledError
```

This skips all index updates, reducing the number of Durable Object writes. You can still use `ablauf.get(Workflow, { id }).getStatus()` to check individual workflows if you know their ID.

## Production Considerations

In production, you'll likely want:

1. **Authentication** on the `/__ablauf` endpoint to prevent unauthorized access
2. **Rate limiting** to protect against abuse
3. **CORS headers** if your dashboard is hosted on a different domain
4. **Reasonable shard counts** for high-volume workflow types (typically 2-8 shards)

Observability adds minimal overhead (one additional Durable Object write per status change), but for extremely high-volume workflows, disabling it and using custom metrics/logging may be more cost-effective.
